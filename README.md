# Club Las Heras
## The long story
The year was 1995. I was a kid who signed up to learn to swim at the neighborhood club. I always arrived early to class so before I got into the pool I would chat with the teacher and the secretary. I found out that they managed the students with paper files and I was studying computer science. One conversation led to another and I offered them a system to eliminate paperwork and use a computer in exchange for free swimming lessons. They had a limited budget so they couldn't get a decent computer. After several weeks of internal politics, they managed to get a 286 that I had to adjust to. I would have liked to do the system in Delphi or maybe Visual Basic, but the hardware didn't help. I had to settle for DOS languages. Since I was learning Pascal in high school, I started like that.

At some point I came across the fact that I wasn't very good with pointers and I needed to manage long lists, so I asked Simon for help. At that point the system started to have different colors and styles because we were stubborn kids and each one wanted to impose his way.

Well... actually, since I was the one who needed the favor, I let him adjust things to his liking because it made him feel better.

Everything was going well until months later, one day Simon told me that now he wanted to be paid. That it was no longer a favor. So... well... that's a different story. The thing is that it started to get ugly and the story ends with me stopping going to swimming and consequently the end of this little programming project in Borland Pascal 7.

## Make it run
The entire thing is in spanish, but I like to write the readme in english. Just because.

To make it run on these days, you will need Dosbox and Borland Pascal 7 installed in it. Honestly I didn't test it yet, but it is very likely yo can open club.pas, hit CTRL+F9 and everything should be more or less working. 

I need to check if there are any config file required. Probably just text files. Because on those days, we used to have monochromatic (Hercules) monitors and VGA monitors. At DOS level, both graphic cards writes in different memory regions: $B800 and $B000 (If I recall correctly). We are talking about vintage things here. It was fun! The club's computer had an Hercules monitor and Simon and me used to have a SVGA monitor.
